Objective:
      - to  develop an application program that reads, writes, and modifies text file contents. The program should demonstrate the use of string methods, regular expressions, and other text-handling techniques.

Instructions:

    File Reading and Writing
        Create a text file containing a sample paragraph (students can write their own or use a provided one).
        Write a  program to read the contents of the file and display it on the screen.
        Modify the program to append additional text to the file without overwriting the existing content.
        Save the modifications and read the file again to ensure the changes are reflected.
    Text Manipulation
        Word Count: Count the number of words in the file and display the result.
        Character Frequency: Count the frequency of each character (case-insensitive) in the text and display the results in a dictionary format.
        Text Replacement: Prompt the user to enter a word or phrase to search for and another word or phrase to replace it with. Use string methods or regular expressions to perform the replacement in the text file.
        Line Modification: Add a feature to insert, delete, or replace specific lines in the text file based on user input.
    Regular Expression Tasks
        Pattern Matching: Implement a search function that uses regular expressions to find all occurrences of a specified pattern in the text.
        Text Extraction: Use regular expressions to extract specific information from the text, such as dates, names, or other patterns relevant to the text content.

    Unique Features

        In addition to the tasks above, students are required to implement at least one unique feature related to text file manipulation
